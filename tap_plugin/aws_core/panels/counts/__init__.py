"""aws-counts — the count tiles on the /aws dashboard (req-aws-core-page-dashboard).

Spec: specs/spec-aws-core-v0.md (req-aws-core-panel-counts).

Each tile is a number the grid can answer about the AWS estate: accounts, OUs, VPCs, the internet
gateways that are its public front doors, internet-facing load balancers, buckets whose public access
is not blocked, firewalls, transit gateway attachments, KMS keys, service control policies, and the
accounts inside each compliance boundary. A panel instance lists the tiles it shows in
``config.tiles`` (default: all, in catalogue order).

Reads go through Gryphon (``execute_gryphon_raw``, gated on ``grid.read``); folding the envelopes into
tiles is pure, so the tests need no grid. A tile whose read fails says so in the tile rather than
showing 0: an error is never rendered as an empty estate. A tile whose nodes are all design nodes
(dcom=design) is marked design, so a planned estate is never read as a built one.

Boundary membership follows the organisation tree: an account is inside a boundary when it, or an OU
it sits under at any depth (NESTED_UNDER_PARENT), is SCOPED_TO_COMPLIANCE_BOUNDARY that boundary.
