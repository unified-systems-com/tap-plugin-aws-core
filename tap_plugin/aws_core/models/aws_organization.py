    """An AWS Organizations organization.

    The organization node also stands for the organization's root. AWS allows exactly one root per
    organization, the root has no facts of its own beyond its id, and every root-level relationship
    (a top-level OU or account, a policy attached at the root) is the organization's. So there is no
    separate root type: the root's id is carried as ``root_id``, and edges that land on "the root"
    land on this node.

    Design vocabulary: no collector emits it yet. Every field is one AWS reports
    (``organizations:DescribeOrganization`` and ``ListRoots``), and every id may be blank because a
    designed organization exists before AWS mints one. Blank means not observed, for the ids and
    for the two enums alike (the aws_elb.lb_type convention).
