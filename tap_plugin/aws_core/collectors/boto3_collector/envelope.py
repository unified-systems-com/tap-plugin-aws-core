"""Configuration envelope + deterministic serialization for the boto3 collector.

Spec: plugins/aws_core/specs/spec-aws-core-collector-v0.md
(req-aws-collector-field-projection "Reserved envelope keys and stable
serialization").

Two engine rules keep a node's ``configuration`` byte-identical across runs
when the resource is unchanged (so re-runs upsert cleanly and History/FLIP
does not churn):

1. ``ResponseMetadata`` is stripped from every boto3 response before it
   becomes an item / ``configuration`` — it carries request ids, retry
   counts, and timestamped headers that would otherwise change every run.
2. Values are normalized deterministically: ``datetime``/``date`` ->
   ISO 8601 UTC (``...Z``); the engine serializes with sorted keys.

The node ``configuration`` is the enumerate item at its root plus the
engine-reserved ``_source`` ({op, why}); ``_hydrate`` / ``_hydrate_mapping``
are added by the fan-out seam (later). ``_source`` is present on every node
so even a single-call object is self-describing without the manifest.
