"""Source primitive for the boto3 collector: the ``aws_op`` driver + dispatch.

Spec: plugins/aws_core/specs/spec-aws-core-collector-v0.md
(req-aws-collector-source).

A manifest entry's ``source`` has two implementations that yield the *same*
thing — an iterable of raw resource items — so the engine never branches on
which was used downstream (``req-aws-collector-source-1``):

- ``aws_op``: a declared boto3 operation, driven generically — the engine
  resolves the client for the service, uses the botocore paginator when the
  operation has one, otherwise calls it once, and extracts items via the
  manifest ``items_path``. No per-resource pagination code
  (``req-aws-collector-source-2``).
- ``custom_fn``: a named callable resolved through a plugin-local registry,
  used only where AWS needs multiple calls to assemble one logical resource.
  Code is **never** loaded from manifest data — the manifest only names the
  callable (``req-aws-collector-source-3``).

``ResponseMetadata`` is stripped from every response before items are
extracted, so it never reaches an item / ``configuration``
(``req-aws-collector-field-projection-6``).
