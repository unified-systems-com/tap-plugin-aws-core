"""Registered ``custom_fn`` callables for the boto3 collector.

Spec: plugins/aws_core/specs/spec-aws-core-collector-v0.md
(req-aws-collector-source / req-aws-collector-hydrate).

A ``custom_fn`` is the thin per-service glue for resources AWS cannot
enumerate richly in one call. It composes the reusable :func:`hydrate_item`
template (it does not hand-roll multi-call logic) and yields raw items in the
same shape an ``aws_op`` would. Code is never loaded from manifest data; the
manifest only names the callable.

S3 is the worst-case fan-out the seam exists for: ``ListBuckets`` returns a
few fields and the compliance-relevant state comes from independent
per-bucket ``GetBucket*`` calls. The hydrate op list lives in the manifest
(``req-aws-collector-hydrate-3``); this glue only supplies the S3-specific
identifier binding (``Bucket=<name>``) and per-bucket region routing (S3
redirects ``GetBucket*`` to the bucket's own region).
