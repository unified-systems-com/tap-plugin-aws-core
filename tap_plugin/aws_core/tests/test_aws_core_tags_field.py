"""The canonical `tags` field on the collected aws_core models.

Covers req-aws-core-fields-4. Uniform name + shape + default so cross-resource
tag queries work by convention; declared in both schemas; never an Entity-spine
facet.

The covered set is DERIVED FROM THE COLLECTOR MANIFEST, not hand-listed. The
v0.4.0 scar: this file used to enumerate "the 8 manifest-collected models" by
hand, six types were added to the manifest without extending the list, and one
of them (secrets_manager_secret) shipped without a `tags` field — the collector
stamps `tags` on every node envelope unconditionally, so core's GRIFT import
(additionalProperties: false) rejected the whole batch on any account with a
Secrets Manager secret. Deriving from the manifest makes the guard fail closed:
a future manifest entry is covered the moment it exists.
